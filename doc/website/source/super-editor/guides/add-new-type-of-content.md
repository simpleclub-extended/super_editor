# Add a New Type of Content
Super Editor ships with a number of standard content types, including paragraphs, images, ordered
and unordered list items, blockquotes, and horizontal rules. However, you may need to implement
editor support for other types of content. Adding new content requires implementing a number
of new behaviors.

## Define a new node type

## Define a new view model, component, and builder

## Add edit requests and commands (optional)

## Add edit reactions (optional)

## Add keyboard handlers (optional)
